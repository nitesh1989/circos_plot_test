\title{Differential Methylation Analysis of H460 Parent and H460 Knock-in cell lines on 2.1M Nimblegen Array}
\author{Nitesh Turaga}
\maketitle



To perform differential methylation analysis of H460 knock-in and H460 parent cell lines.The data was generated by Nimblegen 2.1M microarrays. Raw data are in the form of images (TIF files). Data set included total of 6 samples, 3 for each cell line (H460 knock-in and H460 parent). Array images were processed with DEVA-v1.2 (Nimblegen software for automated feature extraction and data analysis). The TIF files were converted to {\bf XYS} files for analysis. These files report the, {\bf X} - coordinate of the feature on the image, {\bf Y}-coordinate of the feature on the image, and the {\bf S}ignal - the flourescence intensity of the pixels that make the feature. The TIF files were also processed with DEVA using the DNA methylation work flow to identify peaks for each sample.

\section*{Preliminary Assessments}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


General QC-analyses brought to light that the signal intensities and local enrichment at methylated sites were not large. The data quality was assessed by looking at the Enriched channel in the MeDIP array, where we expect every probe to have a signal. Since, the enriched channel has methylated DNA, a successful hybridization would indicate a signal. The array signal is calculated as the average percentile rank of the signal probes among the background probes. The score ranges between 0 to 100, where 100 indicates the ideal scenario or perfect hybridization. This quality score is calculated before any kind of normalization is done on the arrays.


\captionof{table}{Array quality scores}
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    Sample ID                        & Status       & Quality Score     \\ \hline
    542586A01\_Slot9\_2012-07-24\_H460 & H460\_parent & 59.6  \\ \hline
    542737A01\_Slot13\_2012-07-24\_H460 & H460\_parent & 64.4  \\ \hline

As we can in Table 1, the quality score of the H460 Parent arrays are pretty low.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\section*{The CHARM Algorithm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Array quality scores were generated with the  Bioconductor {\tt charm - package}, and data quality was checked using the $Enriched$ channel. Four of the six arrays show a large standard deviation in the signal strenth and seem to have a problem in hybridization.
%
%To estimate the DNA methylation values, the background signal is removed before computing the log-ratios. A within sample normalization method - {\bf loess} is used, and then a between array normalization - quantile  is used. The control probes which are the non-CpG probes are excluded. This provides us a probe-level estimate of DNA methylation from the 2.1M oligonucliotide microarray.
%

CHARM is specifically designed to maximize the number of assayed CpGs .This improves the detection strategy because it facilitates a smoothing strategy and assays many more CpGs.  The basic measurement used to quantify methylation is the log-ratio of the intensities observed in the treated and control channels. To detect methylated regions in the CHARM method, the M-values were normalized and processed using genome-weighted smoothing.\href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2336799/}{(5)}\\

The normalization method uses genome sequence information and knowledge of the fragment selection method to select pseudo-housekeeping probes for which one can in fact assume M = 0. Then apply the Loess normalization procedure developed for expression arrays to the pseudo-housekeeping genes, obtain the correction curve, and use this curve to correct M-values for all probes. To obtain a smoothed M-value at any given genomic location, average all the M-values that were within a prespecified distance from the location in question. The interval providing the values that are averaged is referred to as the “smoothing window” and its length is referred to as the “window size.” \href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2336799/}{(5)} \\

After estimating the DNA methylation values in terms of percentage methylation, we use the regression based DMR-finding approach after correcting for batch effects, which is provided in the {\tt charm-package}. This fails to find DMR’s in the current samples.

\section*{The Bumphunter Algorithm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Bumphunter used to estimate regions for which the genomic profile deviates from a baseline value(cut off). It is implemented to detect differntially methylated genomic regions between two populations. It is also a regression based approach.It reports the result, with a table of candidate differentially methylated regions and the corresponding annotation for wach region.

%
%{\bf Analysis using Bumphunter}
%
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item Run  1
%
%Initially ran {\tt bumphunter} on the data, with cutoff value 1.0, this failed to find any bumps. The sensitivity of the cutoff was not enough to catch any DMRs in the sample set. Bumphunter is better used for large sample sets, for better performance. 
%
%
%\item Run  2
%
%Bumphunter, with the inbuilt argument to pickCutoff was run. The cutoff chosen by bumphunter was at 0.41, bumps found 28206. The number of DMRs/bumps of length greater than four is 0. This result is not useful for analysis as the length of the DMRs are too small.
%
%%bumps.rda file attached. 
%
%The distribution of the length of DMRs found, is shown below. Most of them are single CpG sites of length 1. This does not work for a significant analysis.

\section*{The Nimblegen Algorithm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The standard Nimblegen algorithms were used to compute the normalized data and identify peaks of enrichment, coinciding with methylated regions. Peaks near known transcription start sites (TSS) were identified, with different cutoffs between maximal distance between a peak and TSS.

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item  -500 to +500, the default cutoff
%	\item  -5000 to +1500, a custom cutoff
%\end{itemize}

%{\bf Analysis using Peaks files from DEVA}

In each cell line, the genes which were intersecting among all the samples were identified. All the genes which were identified jointly in both cell lines were removed, making each gene set unique and exclusive for a specific cell line. Both sets of unique and exclusive genes, were ordered by distance from the Transcription start site. 944 genes were identified in H460 knock-in cell line and 349 in H460 parent. (Table 2)

%Sequential intersections, based on the number of peaks identified in each sample, was done in decreasing order for each experimental status. This step results in all the genes within each sample which are intersecting.

%We find the common genes between “H460\_knock-in” and “H460\_parent", and remove these genes from the intersected lists. We then order them by distance from the transcription start site(TSS).

\captionof{table}{Number of features in each cell line}

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

{\bf NOTE:}  Files are attached as “knock-in\_genes\_distFromTSS.csv” and “parent\_genes\_distFromTSS.csv”. The regions are ordered in a decreasing order based on the distance from TSS. \\


The only features left in the result are transcription start sites, other possible feature is CpG Island (column name  is  FEATURE TRACK). The distribution of the distance from the TSS is also shown for both cell lines. Column name is SHORTEST\_DISTANCE\_FROM\_FEATURE\_TO\_DATA\_POINT.\\
